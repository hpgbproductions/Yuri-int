Yuri desktop edit

This is an experimental "interactive wallpaper", a Rainmeter skin that combines the elements of wallpaper and programmed skins.

IMPORTANT: This will only work correctly with a screen size of 1280x720. To make this compatible with other screen sizes, you will need to do a lot of work.

You will need to use a wallpaper of Yuri for this to work. Use the base image found in @Resources.

Run MAIN to use the interactive wallpaper.

TIP: To remove the debug numbers, delete the "Text" parameter under [RandomNumberUpdateMeter].
